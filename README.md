There were 912 theater kickstarters in the U.S., of which 525 were successful (58%). There were 314 play kickstarters in Great Britain, of which 238 were successful (76%). There were 1,395 theatter kickstarters for all countries noted and those that started in May were the most successful. The mean goal was 4,000 British pounds and half of the goals were 2,000 British pounds or less. If Louise would like to move forward with crowdfunding her play "Fever", she should see success in the U.S. and Great Britian, though the $10,000 goal may be a lofty one given the data provided. She can likely experience greater success by kickstarting in May/June/July.
